# Changelog — Grow Product Manager Plugin

All notable changes to this plugin are documented here.

Version format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- **MAJOR** — breaking changes, full workflow restructure across multiple skills
- **MINOR** — new skill added, new step/section in existing skill, significant workflow addition
- **PATCH** — wording fix, small content addition, formatting change, bug fix in skill logic

Each skill also carries its own version in the frontmatter (`version:` field in SKILL.md).
When a skill changes, its version is bumped independently. The plugin version is bumped to reflect the highest-impact change among all updated skills.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-04-01

### Plugin
- Enhanced `meeting-processor` with calendar integration and enriched participant context

### Skills changed
| Skill | From | To | Change type |
|-------|------|----|-------------|
| meeting-processor | 0.8.0 | 0.9.0 | minor — calendar enrichment step + participant context passing |

### Details
- **Step M1d — Calendar enrichment:** After finding a meeting, optionally look up the matching calendar event (Google Calendar MCP or Microsoft Calendar MCP) to extract participants (with emails, roles, RSVP), agenda, attached documents (Google Docs, Confluence, Figma, presentations), organizer, and recurrence info. Reads attached materials for additional context
- **Enhanced M2 data merging:** Calendar data merged with transcript data using priority rules. Discrepancies marked (invited but silent, not invited but spoke)
- **Enhanced M9 skill chaining:** Full participant context (name, email, role, attendance status) now passed to all downstream skills. Per-skill content mapping ensures each target skill gets the data it needs (e.g., participants with roles for task assignment, speaker attribution for research)
- **MoM template updated:** Participants table now includes Email and Status columns

## [0.8.0] — 2026-04-01

| meeting-processor | — | 0.8.0 | new skill |

### Details
- **Two modes:** Process (single meeting → structured MoM or short summary) and Search (cross-meeting query → chronological synthesis)

- **Auto-classification:** 5 meeting types (Grooming, Discovery, Demo/Retro, Status, Brainstorm) with multi-type support, user confirmation
- **Type-adaptive extraction:** common blocks (participants, topics, decisions, action items, open questions) + type-specific blocks (estimates for grooming, quotes for discovery, etc.)
- **Skill chaining:** Grooming → feature-task-creator, Discovery → product-research/requirements-creator, Brainstorm → brainstorm-features, Any → diagram-prototyper
- **Publishing:** Confluence, Notion, local file

## [0.7.0] — 2026-03-31

### Skills changed

### Details
- **Step 6b — Validate field values before creation:** Before creating tasks, the skill now categorizes each field value by confidence level (Certain / Inferred / Uncertain / Unknown), presents inferred values for confirmation, and asks the user for uncertain or unknown values with proposed options
- **Step 12 — Post-creation verification:** After creating all tasks, the skill reads back one task from Jira, runs 9 verification checks (title, parent, reporter, team, labels, components, description, issue type, links), reports discrepancies with severity, proposes fixes, and propagates fixes to all affected tasks
